# Measuring the accuracy of likelihood-free inference

This repository contains code to reproduce figures from a paper on measuring the accuracy of likelihood-free inference. Each notebook is self-contained and only depends on the packages imported at the beginning.

Currently only main-text figures are included. If you are interested in supplementary figures, please get in touch.
