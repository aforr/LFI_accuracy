# Measuring the accuracy of likelihood-free inference

This repository contains Julia code to reproduce figures from a [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.08096).
Each notebook is self-contained and only depends on the packages imported at the beginning. 
The discrete Gaussian notebook for Figs. S1 and S2 saves plots into the folder it is run in; for other figures, plots are displayed in the notebooks, though they currently do not render on Github.

The code is not documented or designed for anything more than reproducing figures in the paper exactly as they were created. If you are interested in other uses, please get in touch.
